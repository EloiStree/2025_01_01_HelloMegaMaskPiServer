If you want to set up a Pi server using MetaMask for authentication that allows remote control of devices, you're in the right place.




"Ma r√©solution pour 2025 : prototyper ce que j'ai en t√™te depuis l'ann√©e pass√©e : un outil permettant de cr√©er des serveurs mutualis√©s sur Raspberry Pi pour une communaut√©, afin de transmettre des entiers d'un ordinateur √† d'autres via une authentification ECC compatible avec celle d'Ethereum et MetaMask."

"My resolution for 2025: to prototype what I've had in mind since last year: a tool that allows the creation of shared Raspberry Pi servers for a community, to transmit integers from one computer to others via an ECC authentication compatible with that of Ethereum and MetaMask."

In the past, I‚Äôve developed macro software that required multiple computers. This quickly turned the project into a nightmare of port forwarding and network complexities. So, my goal now is to create a tool that simplifies all of that.  

I also realized that text-based systems make software easier to hack and harder to manage, especially with dynamic components. A combination of ideas from IFTTT and MQTT, along with MetaMask authentication using integer indexes, best describes what I'm trying to build.  

As a game developer, my aim is to make this tool increasingly user-friendly for the IoT community while also robust enough to handle complex use cases like Twitch Plays games.
